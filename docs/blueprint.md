## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark moss green (#4A6157), evoking a sense of natural intelligence.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated moss green (#F4F5F0).
- Accent color: Muted olive green (#7A8F6A), used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements and indicate status or selections.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body text; a modern, neutral look ensures legibility and cross-platform consistency.
- A clean, intuitive layout with a clear visual hierarchy, ensuring that the most important information and actions are easily accessible. The PromptBar should be prominently displayed at the top, followed by the OutputPane. PresetChips and Toolbar should be logically positioned to support these primary elements.
- Subtle transitions and micro-interactions to enhance the user experience, such as smooth scrolling, gentle highlighting of interactive elements, and animated feedback for actions like copying to the clipboard or clearing the input field.
